We will take a look on employee exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) 
and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

Our aim is to answer on following questions:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? 
  What about employees who have been there longer?

- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees? 

We'll work on combined 2 data sets (dete_survey.csv and tafe_survey.csv) to try answer on questions above.
