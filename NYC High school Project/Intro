In this project, we will work with the NYC High School data and analyze the correlations between sat scores and other possible elements.

There sre some data sets included in this project:

- SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
- School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City
- Class size - Information on class size for each school
- AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
- Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
- Demographics - Demographic information for each school
- School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school
